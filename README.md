## C# iF - ELSE
If else codes are decision-making structures in C# software. The flow of the program is determined by if else. If else controls are used if transactions are to be made depending on a certain condition. Here, the condition is specified in the if statement, if the condition is true, the commands inside the if code block are executed. If the condition is not true, the commands in the else code block are executed. In cases where there is more than one condition, nested if else structures are used. I made 2 desktop applications related to this.
