## C# INTROCTION
I made 3 desktop applications with C# first start topics.

## C# iF - ELSE
If else codes are decision-making structures in C# software. The flow of the program is determined by if else. If else controls are used if transactions are to be made depending on a certain condition. Here, the condition is specified in the if statement, if the condition is true, the commands inside the if code block are executed. If the condition is not true, the commands in the else code block are executed. In cases where there is more than one condition, nested if else structures are used. I made 2 desktop applications related to this.

## SWÄ°TCH-CASE
In multi-state branching statements, switch-case structure is preferably used instead of if-else blocks. It is used when equality is desired.The value to be checked is placed in the case blocks. It is closed with a break.

## FOR LOOP
One of the most basic building blocks of programming is loops. It allows us to write less and more functional coding that will be written over and over.Loops are used in programming to repeatedly execute a certain block of statements until some condition is met.The for loop is also a type of loop that we use most in loops.
